This software aims to help IT management team to pre-audit their organization through surveys. Those surveys can be improved thanks to a back office.

That project is an implementation of a concept designed by friends of mine during an innovation project in 2013. I developed that to help them to show a demo of the concept at the end of the contest.

It took me ~1 week work time during which I learned a lot, especially about how recursive algorithm can be complex to tackle.
